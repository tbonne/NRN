# Network reaction norms: taking into account network position and plasticity in response to environmental change

    Recent studies have highlighted the link between consistent inter-individual differences in behaviour and consistency in social network position. To better consider variation in network position and plasticity simultaneously we introduce the network reaction norm (NRN) approach. As an illustrative example we used behavioural data on chacma baboons, collected over a period of seven years, to construct a time series of networks using a moving window approach. We used these data with NRN to quantify both the consistency with which individuals maintained social behaviour (node strength) and central positions (eigenvector centrality) within the social network, as well as variation in how an individual responded to changes in the environment.
